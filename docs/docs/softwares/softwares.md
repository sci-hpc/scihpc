# Which software is installed on Scicluster

The easiest way to check which software and versions available is to use
the  ``module`` command.

List all software available:

```bash
module avail
```

See the next section [Software Module Scheme](./modules.md) for details.
## Conda


Many software packages, especially if they are python based, can be easily installed using
the Conda package manager.

A small tutorial can be found in the [python](./python.md) section of this documentation.
