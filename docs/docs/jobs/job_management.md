# Managing jobs

The lifecycle of a job can be managed with as little as three different
commands:

- Submit the job with ``sbatch <script_name>``.
- Check the job status with ``squeue``. (to limit the display to only
   your jobs use ``squeue -u <user_name>``.)
- (optional) Delete the job with ``scancel <job_id>``.

You can also hold the start of a job: ``scontrol hold <job_id>``, put a hold on the job. A job on hold will not start or block other jobs from starting until you release the hold. ``scontrol release <job_id>``, release the hold on a job.


## Job status descriptions in squeue

When you run ``squeue`` (probably limiting the output with ``squeue -u <user_name>``), you will get a list of all jobs currently running or waiting to start. Most of the columns should be self-explaining, but the *ST* and *NODELIST (REASON)* columns can be confusing.

*ST* stands for *state*. The most important states are listed below. For a more comprehensive list, check the [squeue help page section Job State Codes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html#lbAG).

- *R*  The job is running
- *PD*  The job is pending (i.e. waiting to run)
- *CG* The job is completing, meaning that it will be finished soon

The column *NODELIST (REASON)* will show you a list of computing nodes the job is running on if the job is actually running. If the job is pending, the column will give you a reason why it still pending. The most important reasons are listed below. For a more comprehensive list, check the [squeue help page section Job Reason Codes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html#lbAF).

- *Priority*
  There is another pending job with higher priority
- *Resources*
  The job has the highest priority, but is waiting for some running job to finish.

- *launch failed requeued held*
  Job launch failed for some reason. This is normally due to a faulty node. Please contact us, stating the problem, your user name, and the jobid(s).
- *Dependency*
  Job cannot start before some other job is finished. This should only happen if you started the job with ``--dependency=...``
- *DependencyNeverSatisfied*
  Same as *Dependency*, but that other job failed. You must cancel the job with ``scancel JOBID``.
