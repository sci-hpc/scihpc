[BHAC](https://bhac.science/) (the Black Hole Accretion Code) is a multidimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code based on the [MPI-AMRVAC](https://amrvac.org/)framework. BHAC solves the equations of ideal general 
relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in one, two or three dimensions on arbitrary stationary space-times, using an efficient block based approach.

See [here](../../docs/softwares/apps/astrophysics/BHAC/BHAC.md) to learn how to run this code on Scicluster.
