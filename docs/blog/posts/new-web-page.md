# New webpage for Scicluster

OK! Finally I found some time to work on a new webpage for Scicluster. I built this webpage using [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). I hope we can continue adding useful contents that help to learn HPC better and use Scicluster more efficiently.
